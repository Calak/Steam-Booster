  SteamBooster helps you login to Steam fast if you are constantly 
moving between computers. It does this by skipping the user/password window. 
As Steam users know you can't login on more than one system at a time without 
having the password cleared out of memory. This script also lets multiple user's
login to different accounts with a click of a button. The one click user change
will close all games and logout of one user and login as another. Give it a
try all you need is Steam, this script, and Python3. Steam Booster can run on
MS-Windows, GNU/Linux, or Apple. Have fun and game on.
